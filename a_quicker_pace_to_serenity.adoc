"_*I am not a body. I am free.*_
_*For I am still as God created me.*_

"We have a function that transcends the World we see, that is:

"_*a deep relinquishment of everything that clutters up the mind and makes it def to reason, sanity, and simple truth._*

"Attempt to get beyond all words for this review...

"A quicker pace to the serenity and peace of God.

"We close our eyes and merely forget all that we thought we knew and understand... For this is freedom given us from all we didn't know and failed to understand.

"Permit no idle thought to go unchallenged... 

* "_*This thought I do not want.*_

* _*I choose instead __________.*_

* And repeat the idea for the day and let it take the place instead.
