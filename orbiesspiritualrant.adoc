> Orbyness: Everything descends from heaven upon the earth, into the water, into the air: only fire is vivifying, because it tends upwards; that which tends downwards is subordinate to it. That which descends from above is generative; that which emanates and rises is nutritive. The earth, alone self-supported, is the receptacle of all things, and reconstructs the types which she receives. That Universal Being which contains All and which is All, puts into motion the soul and the world, all that nature comprises. In the manifold unity of universal life, the innumerable individualities distinguished by their variations, are, nevertheless, united in such a manner that the whole is one, and that everything proceeds from unity.

> Orbyness: If it is forgiveness for sinning, then that is forgiveness to destroy, which is a power of the vicious cycle of the ego, but on the other hand, advanced forgiveness of the realisation that there is nothing to forgive, for we are all one, and there is no such thing as matter, nor bodies that experience a separation from the eternal life force current of eternal life, that is the forgiveness to heal and awaken the mind to the true purpose of realising we never left our right mind, except in a nightmare of dystopia of separation from prime creator and each other of a wish for the unreal to be true of fragmentation in time and space as a puppet of matter that never happened in reality, and so this realist type of forgiveness takes you back up the ladder to heaven the ego led us down in, in thinking that in the energetically linked eternal moment of the total now of having an infinite oneness experience with prime creator is the meaning and purpose of holographic forgiveness.

> Vernacular cant take you further then images, for all images hold shape and content, and all content holds shape of an image, and words or vernacular are extensions of the symbols of those images which create the mind, but the minds eye is what then? more then a pregnant thought? more then a birthing into the most lucid understanding of what is all but mere simplicities flow. All we can say is isness or flow and that words are not fragmented in time and space but are a whole body in heaven on earth

> Orbyness: master slut face please respond to this that i said to you earlier in the eon

Orbyness: If it is forgiveness for sinning, then that is forgiveness to destroy, which is a power of the vicious cycle of the ego, but on the other hand, advanced forgiveness of the realisation that there is nothing to forgive, for we are all one, and there is no such thing as matter, nor bodies that experience a separation from the eternal life force current of eternal life, that is the forgiveness to heal and awaken the mind to the true purpose of realising we never left our right mind, except in a nightmare of dystopia of separation from prime creator and each other of a wish for the unreal to be true of fragmentation in time and space as a puppet of matter that never happened in reality, and so this realist type of forgiveness takes you back up the ladder to heaven the ego led us down in, in thinking that in the energetically linked eternal moment of the total now of having an infinite oneness experience with prime creator is the meaning and purpose of holographic forgiveness

> Orbyness: he coulnt handle this truth

> Orbyness: We get angry because we think we are justified in our guilt we have for destroying heaven and perfect oneness, and so we think ideas leave their source, so we pray to the decision maker even though our dualistically geared ego body mind of a material world that never happened, to a body that doesn't exist, praying to a god that knows nothing about the real you for you never left heaven in the perfect oneness and perfect love of the right mind that is the home of the holy spirit. So in the end when we pray we are only praying to ourselves, and so the miracle restores to the mind the awareness this world is a wish for the unreal to be true, of time and space and bodies and a world of order of difficulties to miracles and a need to transcend the cycle of birth and death, for in truth there is no opposite to life, and the total now of the presence of prime creator is the eternal life force current that is your highest vibration of the highest feeling of eternal peace love and joy

> Orbyness: How quickly you understand the reason of things, Asclepios! I have not yet said that all is one and that one is All, since all things were in the Creator before the creation and we can call Him All since All things are His members. Wherefore, throughout all this discourse, bear in mind Him who is One and All, the Creator of all things.

> Orbyness: There are two alters, there are two camps, the innocent and guilty cannot communicate their highest thoughts, one camp speaks the thought system of birth and death and sin guilt and fear, while the other camp speaks the thought system of perfect oneness and perfect love and eternal life on earth. There are two types of people on the planet and you can't just say " and i dont like them " for you intrinsically waste your hands and feet to feed one of the camps bellies.
