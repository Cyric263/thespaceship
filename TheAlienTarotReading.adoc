= The Alien Tarot Reading

= Debriefing 

=== You wake up and find an Alien infront of you.  Telepathically, he floats four cards into your brain...  The message reads:

= The Hermit

=== The Hermit goes out into the world to sort good from bad and spread positive vibrations.  He spreads love, light, joy, happiness, wholeness, unity, harmony, balance, peace, healing.  He calms minds and bodies. He relaxes minds and bodies.

= The Nine of Pentacles

=== The Nine of Pentacles or nine of floating, churning disks represent the good energies you have created.  You must re-evaluate and re-focus on the energies to see where you can improve them.  Once the Disks have been elevated you are ready to share them with the rest of the world.

= The Ten of Cups

=== The Ten of Cups holds the soul's energy in which you have the power to mold and create anything.  Through purpose, feeling, and expectations you let the souls energy flow and manifest unlimited possiblities of goodness for you and the people around you.     

= The High Priestess

=== The Queen or High Priestess identifies, defines, and writes her principles and wishes in her great book so she can emit the highest frequences of growth and love to the world.

= The Journey

=== You hear a _"WooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHHH!"_ sound; a blue robe appears around you; a whisper says....

= Begin Your Journey!
