The following is a sample of the insight and wisdom that flows from the Archangels Lilith and Heylal, channeled by Pamela Aaralyn. Pamela Aaralyn has been speaking directly with the Ascended Masters, Angels and Archangels for many years since they first revealed themselves to her as a child. Throughout the many years of humbly and authentically recording these conversations for all who will hear, the messages are increasingly becoming more direct, pointed and unequivocal about addressing the true needs of humanity.

I am Lilith, the keeper of all of your children, the author of perspectives, the one within you that seeks darkness, the one within you that feels safe within light. You are the author of your own stories, I am the catalyst who urges you to release all stories and return to a blank slate of truth for further creation. I am ready to hear your questions.

*What is the true story of your creation and what do you represent?*

You have authored many stories, some represent darkness, some represent light. Within many of your collectives of religion you continue to perceive the essence of a fall, as if grace could be taken from you. You have perceived fear from the basis of birth in your human collectives, and you believe that you are born into sin. You believe from the beginning that you have missed the mark in something, and how can that ever be true?

Will you believe that you are gods, or will you believe the opposite?

You cling to many dualistic notions and stories, there is something in between those stories that I represent. You come with an assumption that I represent feminine, you come with an assumption that I detest masculine. You come with assumptions and stories that I am demonic, you come in fear that I would steal your kids or warp your minds. Only one of those stories is true.

Are you your minds? For if you believe this, the mind will spin with these truths that I present today. You might even leave this message challenging any belief that you ever owned. If you choose, you will also challenge allowing such beliefs to own you.

How deeply will you allow your beliefs to own you? I am the great releaser of these stories, and if you cling to them, you will indeed have karmic difficulties. In my world, karma exists to catalyze you, to bring forth every story from the beginnings of your collectives. There were no original religions. Earth was peaceful and loving, Earth operated within one belief and that was love. But then your religions began.

There are many stories, Adam and Lilith, Amilius and Lilith, Adam and Eve, many names. Adam does not exist and Eve does not exist. The actual incarnations these stories are based on were Amilius and myself.

This is the point of creation that occurred, where the birth of duality began. Heylal loved you enough to allow this dualistic choice of darkness and light, feminine and masculine, good and bad, right and wrong.

Within your stories, you created a man named Adam, and then you made up the story that I was outcast from Adam. Within that same story I would not lay under him and he would not lie under me. And of course, why would I want to? The truth is, he did not want to be under or over and I did not want to be under or over. Before your stories, before your religions and texts, we both wanted to be equal.

Your religions created an entire opportunity to catalyze humanity. If I did not want to lie under him then perhaps I am resisting being owned by him, then I am controlled by him, then I am powerless. In truth, neither Amilius nor myself ever felt any connection to these stories. We operated beautifully together when we were incarnated, and we continue to do so amongst your children today. Your false stories and confusion began when your religions corrupted these stories.

You are Source. We are all within unity and oneness. Within this power and equality you choose to create everything that I represent. In all of your stories, I am the dark, demonic entity that you choose to believe in and it becomes quite real for you. How much longer will this story serve you?

In our dimension, which is one of non-duality, we have a beautiful life. There was no casting out until you changed our story to become much different. You created this belief, and I honored your story. I allowed myself to play this role in the stories of your religions. Our life is beautiful regardless of the fabrication and assumption of sin.

*Did we cast you into the shadow aspects of Eve, those polarizing aspects?*

In your stories, you become polarized aspects of yourselves. What are you doing to yourselves? How much longer will you insist upon your insanities? How much longer will you cling to your idea that sin is real and that fear is real? Fear is your tool, you can honor whatever moment you stand in no matter what it is, but you shun all emotions unless they are bright, beautiful, and full of light.

Then you shun yourselves and become outcasts of yourselves. You begin the process of separation the moment you shun, judge, and extricate yourselves from Source. Then with every judgment that you have, you become more and more powerless as a collective. I am here today to teach you this truth, to pull forth your egos and show them to you.

*How can today’s women support the evolution of today’s men into a new understanding of relationships that is less patriarchal?*

Release your stories. As women, the best way that you can understand a divine masculine being is to release the concept that you are woman or man; you are genderless. Consider the many collectives that are coming in to represent genderless roles, they do not perceive themselves as men or women, they do not perceive themselves as bodies or sexualities. They are within their hearts, not within their parts. What if you simply perceived your partner as an aspect of you, that you both are in service to each other without feeling repressed, sacrificed or entitled?

How can you wish to be supported without also deepening your support? You and your egos spin on the potter’s wheel, around and around, embellishing your stories, “I must be supported”, “I am not supported”, “I must be loved”, “I am not loved”.

Release the must, release the not, release the should, release the shouldn’t. Let what comes before you in your relationship simply arise within the perfect will of Source, which is you. How could anything be wrong? Release shame, release judgment, release definitions of worthiness and unworthiness and simply see a soul as a soul that is a part of you. And that is all. All else will be revealed to you the moment you are ready… so are you?

*What do you believe about feminism, and how do you feel about the state of the Divine Masculine and the Divine Feminine?*

You cling to these evil tales, do you not? You cling to separation and disempowerment as if they were something you should defend, or as a sword that you must plunge into the heart of the patriarchal system, as though it were bad.

If something is done to you, are you not implying that an entire system is against you and that you are separated from such a collective? Does separation not imply fear? In order to defend, or be offensive, you must believe that you are attacked. Yet on another hand, you wish for love, you wish for connection, you wish for unity. You are hypocrites. You are living a lie by saying “I stand for empowerment” and then perpetuating separation. Then you wonder why you don’t have male partners. Need I say more? Or are you offended? Because, if you are offended, I will continue.

*Are you part of the Kali Ma energies which embody the destroyer? How can we use your energy as a means to improve our lives?*

If you wish to use darker energies and magic to better your life, you must perceive the power of Oneness, the power of unity, the power of the void, and you must erase your belief that any emotion is evil. Then all time will stop and play into your hands, for you are the potter and the world will be your wheel. What would you create? This depends upon if you are still trapped in the snare of fear.

*Can you comment on the extent to which polarities are running the mainstream culture here on Earth, and the high incidence of people being born in the wrong suit or gender.*

There you go, the wrong suit or gender. Do you not believe in the power to choose your suit? Then you question ‘what is’ and feel as if honoring the suit is reality? The body is not your reality, your sexuality is not your reality. Your body is your tool and your sexuality is your pleasure, your connection, your means of creation. Any way that you express in the nature you come through will rise within the kundalini energy of your sexuality.

If there is darkness, it will be expanded through sexuality. If there is love, it will be expanded through sexuality. If you feel disempowered you are aligned with being the victim of a rapist. If you feel vulnerable and shamed you are aligned with being the victim of a narcissist.

Nothing can be wrong. If you are born into a body, it is right as long as you know that you are not that body. Why would you allow your body to become your controller by saying “My body says I’m male, my body says I’m female, my body says, my body is, my body says, my body is”, and round and round and round… When will you stop? You are not your bodies and you are not your minds. Take your power back and understand even further beyond those notions. Your power is always there and it cannot be relinquished. This is the divine truth of All-That-Is.

*What would you want us to learn at this stage of human development?*

That question is insane. For all truths go within yourself. You are not here to find something to do as if you were bored teenagers. You act as if you were babies who need toys. You are powerful gods, and yet, just as innocent as beautiful babies. Simply pick something and do it, feel it and be it. You are creators, you are here to play, you are here to be helpful, you are here to return to love. You are here within sound, you are here within light, you are here to resonate to your very own cellular truth. Release all that you believe ‘is’, reset, start over, and re-experience the glory of Source within.

*How can we best embrace our shadow selves?*

Stand in the awareness of the opportunity that the emotions lend to you. Do not rip the emotions out of your presence by trying to transcend them with light when you are not ready. You wish for validation, be the validation. You wish for acceptance, therefore stop judging. You wish to be seen, open your eyes. You wish to be heard, open your ears. You wish to be loved, open your hearts. It is quite simple.

Everything here in your 3rd dimensional existence is likely not true. Your religions, they are not true. Your definitions and labels, your politics, your paradigms, they are not true, not an ounce of truth. And then what? When you stand without the clothing of these paradigms, how do you feel? Does it feel lonely? Are you scared? Then hold yourselves in love, stand in the void minus fear, and understand that without the incessant chatter of your minds and your stories and your egos, that you can create in a different way, that way is all.

How can you be here to be enlightened when you are already light? Simply be within the stillness without fear. Then from this stillness what arises? An equality once more.
