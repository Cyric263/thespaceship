"The forces of darkness will seem +
  to be influencing the planet +
    but this is not true. +

The focus behind the darkness +
  want you to believe but +
    the forces of light +
have pushed the balance to the side +
    of light. +

Shift your attention to light, you, love +
  all around you and all the time. +

Simply focus on the light. +
  Feel it's power within your being. +

I am healthy and rich with each breath +
  of light. +

See the light filling every cell of your +
  body - it is instantaneous. +

Even the deadest of food can be enliven by +
  the power of the blessing of the food. +

Hold hands above food and drink, +
  thank and bless all beings +
        and dimensions. +

And see light from central sun +
  into crown chalkra. +

See and feel the light filling your +
  body with health and energy. +

You add light to the world when you +
  do this. +

Bless food or other people with Love +
  Silently. +

When you do spiritual work I will +
  transform you from within. +

It will be effortless by Divine Self +
  or I AM Presence. +

It is the source of transformations in +
  your body. +

Divine Self has all the Power and +
  Wisdom to make the transformations. +

Be *open* and *willing* to follow *intuition*."
